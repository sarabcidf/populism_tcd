  abstract = {This title was first published in 2001. An important critical study of the theories of dependency both past and present. Since the theories of dependency are based on the Marxian notion of exploitation and backwardness, the book starts with the elaboration of the Marxian theory of development and underdevelopment. The book analyses various concepts and precepts of dependency as well as critically discussing the individual theories of Baran, Frank, Amin, Emmanuel, Prebisch and Singer. The contributions of more recent writers including Furtado, Kay, Wallerstein and Marini are also considered. The main focus of the book lies in the thorough analysis of all the important traditional as well as modern theories of dependency. The main message of the present book is that the phenomenology of dependency is still relevant as a methodology of study of development and underdevelopment. The book incorporates some pressing contemporary issues to give fresh flavour to the old dependency debate. A special feature of the book lies in the critical appraisal for each of the theories studied. The book is designed to serve as a valuable compendium for students of economic development and political economy and for those interested in the study of the economic backwardness of the Third World countries.},

  abstract = {The International Social Science Journal, founded by UNESCO in 1949, is published quarterly in six language editions: English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and Russian. Three decades ago, on the pages of this journal, the Swiss sociologist Volker Bornschier (1980), in a summary of path-breaking empirical investigations, which vindicated much of the thinking of the social sciences from Latin America, critical of the dependency relations of the global `South' from the developed `North', broke a long-standing taboo in the social sciences of the developed countries by predicting that the effects of multinational corporations on economic growth and social inequality in their host countries are not entirely positive. In the 103 countries, statistically investigated by Bornschier in the period 1960-1977, the short-term effect of fresh foreign direct investment for economic growth was found to be significantly positive; but the long-term effect of multinational corporations, especially in the poorer countries of Africa, Asian and Latin America, was significantly negative. Three decades of neo-liberalism ever since, of course, were characterized by the return to the old and up to the 1970s dominant belief that open markets, foreign direct investment, and non-intervention by governments are the ideal and only receipt for long-term stable economic growth and full employment. Is Bornschier's message still valid, three decades later, in the middle of the biggest world economic recession since the 1930s? The aim of this article is to show the basic validity of the then research design and research question with the data of today. Should we in the global ``North'', most seriously affected by the current crisis, finally learn the lessons offered by the experience of the periphery (i.e. the majority of the countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania) and the semi-periphery (i.e. the countries which are positioned between the periphery and core countries, like China, India, and Mexico) in earlier periods of development in the world economy? And should especially Europe begin to study the experiences of Latin America and should it finally learn that dependence indeed has a critical impact on the overall long-term development trends of a nation and that it tends towards the polarization of social relations, which we now witness all over Europe? Now that dependency and penetration by the multinational corporations have risen in Europe to staggering proportions, as we will demonstrate in this article? The rediscovery of the radical `dependency' perspective means a fundamental break with the existing dominant thinking on the subject during the current crisis in the global economy. The logic of European Union policy making, especially, is still geared towards the `internal market' and the four `big' freedoms of trade, capital, services and investment (Tausch, Ghymers, 2007).},

It explores some suggestions about how to further the analysis of dependent development situations. Dependency theory has become one of the foremost interpretations of development as well as a critical challenge to conventional development theory. More explicitly, if the concept of dependency entailed different things in the world, it is likely that the various concepts would relate in different ways to other, independent concepts, the most important of which would be development. The dependency orientation explicitly rejects the unified state-as-actor of the dependence approach. Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Enzo Faletto emphasize the functional incompleteness of the domestic economy and the way in which domestic gaps are filled in by an external complement; other definitions of dependency emphasize other factors. Any critical evaluation of dependency theory must start with a definition of the key concept.},

By reviewing dependency theory and its variant `world system theory', this chapter attempts to find out whether dependency theory can be regarded as an alternative in explaining the growing economic relationship between China and Africa. Dependency theory discusses both internal and external determinant of development and sheds a unique light on the realities of the South--South trade cooperation and in this context China--Africa relations. I discuss the inherence of dependency and argue that the theory provides a useful framework for research in the current context of China--Africa economic engagement. I argue that China in Africa is a potential replacement to the continent's traditional trading partners and this may turn to be a shift for Africa from old dependency to a new one.},

Based on an analysis of more than 400 papers published in high-impact economic journals between 1997 and 2017, we highlight three core trade narratives that stand for different biases apparent in the elite economic discourse on trade: ``trade championing'', ``Ignorance in a world full of nails'' and ``microfounding trade benefits''. Further insights derived from citation analysis of five development studies journals and a case-study-oriented approach that focusses on the reception of this particular trade debate in World Development suggests that these biased trade narratives are effectively transmitted into development research.},

  abstract = {Dependency theory is the idea that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. A central contention of dependency theory is that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "world system". This theory was officially developed in the late 1960s following World War II, as scholars searched for the root issue in the lack of development in Latin America.The theory arose as a reaction to modernization theory, an earlier theory of development which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy.Some writers have argued for its continuing relevance as a conceptual orientation to the global division of wealth. Dependency theorists can typically be divided into two categories: liberal reformists and neo-Marxists. Liberal reformists typically advocate for targeted policy interventions, while the neo-Marxists believe in a command-centered economy.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the hypothesis that dependency rates and poverty adversely affect private savings in developing countries (LDCs) by using panel data from a one-shot survey of peasant households in Northern Tanzania. Overall, the multivariate regression results demonstrate that dependency rates have a statistically significant influence on savings in poor households and an insignificant positive effect on savings in rich households. The same positive but insignificant influence of dependency rates also obtains in the overall sample results and, by and large, when the dependency ratio is disaggregated. Empirical analysis also shows that wealth and income are determinants of savings in the rich peasant households and only cultivated land (per capita) determines savings in poor peasant households. The estimated income elasticity of savings is greater in the rich household than in the poor households, implying the latter saves less out of current income. The empirical results of this paper fail to support the 'claimed' adverse effect of dependency rates on savings in the LDCs, at least in the sampled area in Tanzania. This empirical finding undermines birth control policy measures in Tanzania. Besides, to the extent that rich households save more out of income and wealth underscores targeting of financial saving instruments to the rich rural households and, the adoption of policies that would increase saving capacities of poor households is implicit from the results. The findings and the main conclusions of this study need, however, to be treated cautiously because of the specificity of the area covered. Further exposure to data of the dependency ratios-savings nexus to household budget survey data is required. Sur la base de donn{\'e}es recueillies au cours d'une {\'e}tude sur les m{\'e}nages paysans dans le Nord de la Tanzanie, cet article se propose de v{\'e}rifier l'hypoth{\`e}se d'apr{\`e}s laquelle, dans les pays en voie de d{\'e}veloppement, le taux de d{\'e}pendance et la pauvret{\'e} influeraient negativement sur l'{\'e}pargne priv{\'e}e.

Two kinds of international economic dependence are studied: investment dependence, the penetration of a country by foreign capital and debt dependence, the dependence of a government on foreign credit. The dependent variables studied include three measures of aggregate economic development: gross national product per capita, kilowatt hours of electricity consumed and the percentage of the male labor force not employed in agriculture. In addition, two control variables are included in the analysis: domestic capital formation and the extent to which the national economy is specialized in mining. The research design employed is panel regression analysis, which utilizes data at two points in time (1950 and 1970). The results indicate that both types of international economic dependence have overall negative effects on aggregate economic development. A cross-sectional estimate of the dependence effects on income inequality produces positive, though not statistically significant effects. It is concluded that dependency theories predict the effects of inputs from advanced nations to less-developed ones better than neo-classical international economic theories or sociological modernization theories.},

To do so, we employ 25 series, some of them starting as far back as 1650 and powerful panel data stationarity tests that allow for endogenous multiple structural breaks. Results show that all the series are stationary after allowing for endogeneous multiple breaks. Test results on the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis, which states that relative commodity prices follow a downward secular trend, are mixed but with a majority of series showing negative trends. We also make a first attempt at identifying the potential drivers of the structural breaks. We end by investigating the dynamics of the volatility of the 25 relative primary commodity prices also allowing for endogenous multiple breaks. We describe the often time-varying volatility in commodity prices and show that it has increased in recent years.},

  title = {Unequal Exchange},
  year = {2023},
  month = aug,
  journal = {Wikipedia},
  urldate = {2023-10-24},
  abstract = {Unequal exchange is used primarily in Marxist economics, but also in ecological economics (more specifically also as ecologically unequal exchange), to denote forms of exploitation hidden in or underwriting trade. Unequal exchange is usually calculated by assuming that any trade between a country with a high price level and a country with a low price level, is exploitation.  Originating, in the wake of the debate on the Singer--Prebisch thesis, as an explanation of the falling terms of trade for underdeveloped countries, the concept was coined in 1962 by the Greco-French economist Arghiri Emmanuel to denote an exchange taking place where the rate of profit has been internationally equalised, but wage-levels (or those of any other factor of production) have not. It has since acquired a variety of meanings, often linked to other or older traditions which perhaps then raise claims to priority.  In the works of Paul A. Baran, and subsequently adopted in the dependency approach of Andre Gunder Frank, there is a related but distinct concern with the transfer of values due to superprofits. This did not refer to the terms of trade, but to the transfer taking place within multinational corporations (called "monopolies"). Versions of unequal exchange originating within the dependency tradition are commonly based on some such concern with monopoly and center-periphery trade in general. Here, if unequal exchange occurs in trading, the effect is, that producers, investors and consumers incur either higher costs or lower incomes (or both) in the buying and selling of commodities than they would have, if the commodities had traded at their ``real'' or "true" value. In that case, they are disadvantaged in trading, and their market position is worsened, rather than strengthened. On the other side, the beneficiaries of the trade obtain a superprofit. This term implies that the beneficiaries of unequal exchange are capitalists or entrepreneurs, whereas as understood by Emmanuel the beneficiaries are the high-wage country consumers or workers. The most renowned of those adopting the term is Samir Amin, who tried to link it to his own argument on the interdependent uneven development of rich and poor countries. Ernest Mandel also adopted the term, although his theory was based rather on that of the East-German Marxist Gunther Kohlmey. The most common approach within Marxism is to talk about unequal exchange whenever unequal labour values are being exchanged (e.g., John Roemer), and this type of approach has then been elaborated in recent decades by ecological economists, based instead on, e.g. ecological footprints or energy. Depending on definition, the historical occurrence of unequal exchange can be traced to anything from the origins of trade itself, not limited to the capitalist mode of production, to the origins of significant international wage-differentials, or to the post-war appearance of a significant net-inflow of raw-materials to the developed countries. In the approach of Immanuel Wallerstein the origins of the modern world-system, or what others, such as Ernest Mandel, would call the rise of merchant capitalism, is said to have entailed unequal exchange, although the idea was criticised by Robert Brenner. Another aspect of these theories is the criticism of fundamental assumptions of Ricardian and neoclassical theories of comparative advantage, which could be taken to imply that international trade would have the effect of equalising the economic position of the trading partners. More generally, the concept was a criticism of the idea that the operation of markets would have egalitarian effects, rather than accentuating the market position of the strong and disadvantaging the weak. Modern liberal economists work under the assumption that value is essentially a question of style, moral behavior and the spirituality of individuals, not an economic issue. If unfair trading practices occur, it must be that there is an impediment to freely competitive markets; and if those markets or market access could be open, all would be fair. Marxian economists, on the other hand, argue that the cheap labor found in undeveloped economies allows for profit which would not be possible where wages are higher.  Raul Prebisch and Hans Singer hypothesized that the price of raw materials declines relative to finished industrial products.  This makes "peripheral" countries rich in resources tend towards less power in trade.},

In this highly prescient book, originally published in 1997, he provides a powerful analysis of the new unilateral capitalist era following the collapse of the Soviet model, and the apparent triumph of the market and globalization.Amin's innovative analysis charts the rise of ethnicity and fundamentalism as consequences of the failure of ruling classes in the South to counter the exploitative terms of globalization. This has had profound implications and continues to resonate today. Furthermore, his deconstruction of the Bretton Woods institutions as managerial mechanisms which protect the profitability of capital provides an important insight into the continued difficulties in reforming them. Amin's rejection of the apparent inevitability of globalization in its present polarising form is particularly prophetic - instead he asserts the need for each society to negotiate the terms of its inter-dependence with the rest of the global economy.A landmark work by a key contemporary thinker.},

  abstract = {In this article Samir Amin sets out the core of his model of the global accumulation of capital. In it he defines two distinct patterns: one applying to development at the centre, the other to dependent development in the periphery. Central development is characterised by the dominance of economic activity to satisfy mass consumer needs and the consequent demand for production goods. The power of the masses is enlisted in a `social contract' which allows the establishment of a limited economic viability, at a national level. However, the internationalisation of productive capital increasingly threatens that stability. The peripheral systems are dominated by production of luxury goods and exports and the consequent lack of importance of internal mass markets. This leads to growing inequality, technological dependence, political weakness among the oppressed --- in sum, marginalization. Restructuring of these economies requires a break with the international economy, and self-centred development which establishes the dominance of production for mass needs, though there are particular difficulties for individual countries attempting such a break and ultimately a solution can be found only if such changes take place internationally. Policies for the difficult period of transition must first and foremost focus on the need to build the political consciousness necessary to complete tills process.}

Instead, they found that they had exchanged old forms of political and economic dependence for a new kind of dependency on the international capitalism of multinational corporations. In the much-acclaimed original Spanish edition (Dependencia y Desarrollo en Am{\'e}rica Latina) and now in the expanded and revised English version, Cardoso and Faletto offer a sophisticated analysis of the economic development of Latin America.The economic dependency of Latin America stems not merely from the domination of the world market over internal national and ``enclave'' economies, but also from the much more complex interact ion of economic drives, political structures, social movements, and historically conditioned alliances. While heeding the unique histories of individual nations, the authors discern four general stages in Latin America's economic development: the early outward expansion of newly independent nations, the political emergence of the middle sector, the formation of internal markets in response to population growth, and the new dependence on international markets. In a postscript for this edition, Cardoso and Faletto examine the political, social and economic changes of the past ten years in light of their original hypotheses.},

In the political sense, this implies the influences actors like the state have on socio-economic practices and the shaping of institutions via political decision-making.Relevant variables for the study of political institutions include the structures that indicate voting rules, the political system, preferences and ideological leanings of leaders.},

  journal = {Wikipedia},
  urldate = {2023-10-26},
  abstract = {Institutional economics focuses on understanding the role of the evolutionary process and the role of institutions in shaping economic behavior. Its original focus lay in Thorstein Veblen's instinct-oriented dichotomy between technology on the one side and the "ceremonial" sphere of society on the other. Its name and core elements trace back to a 1919 American Economic Review article by Walton H. Hamilton. Institutional economics emphasizes a broader study of institutions and views markets as a result of the complex interaction of these various institutions (e.g. individuals, firms, states, social norms). The earlier tradition  continues today as a leading heterodox approach to economics."Traditional" institutionalism rejects the reduction of institutions to simply tastes, technology, and nature (see naturalistic fallacy). Tastes, along with expectations of the future, habits, and motivations, not only determine the nature of institutions but are limited and shaped by them. If people live and work in institutions on a regular basis, it shapes their world views. Fundamentally, this traditional institutionalism (and its modern counterpart institutionalist political economy) emphasizes the legal foundations of an economy (see John R. Commons) and the evolutionary, habituated, and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed (see John Dewey, Thorstein Veblen, and Daniel Bromley). Institutional economics focuses on learning, bounded rationality, and evolution (rather than assuming stable preferences, rationality and equilibrium).  It was a central part of American economics in the first part of the 20th century, including such famous but diverse economists as Thorstein Veblen, Wesley Mitchell, and John R. Commons. Some institutionalists see Karl Marx as belonging to the institutionalist tradition, because he described capitalism as a historically bounded social system; other institutionalist economists disagree with Marx's definition of capitalism, instead seeing defining features such as markets, money and the private ownership of production as indeed evolving over time, but as a result of the purposive actions of individuals. A significant variant is the new institutional economics from the later 20th century, which integrates later developments of neoclassical economics into the analysis. Law and economics has been a major theme since the publication of the Legal Foundations of Capitalism by John R. Commons in 1924. Since then, there has been heated debate on the role of law (a formal institution) on economic growth. Behavioral economics is another hallmark of institutional economics based on what is known about psychology and cognitive science, rather than simple assumptions of economic behavior. Some of the authors associated with this school include Robert H. Frank, Warren Samuels, Marc Tool, Geoffrey Hodgson, Daniel Bromley, Jonathan Nitzan, Shimshon Bichler, Elinor Ostrom, Anne Mayhew, John Kenneth Galbraith and Gunnar Myrdal, but even the sociologist C. Wright Mills was highly influenced by the institutionalist approach in his major studies.},

The impact of KA is evaluated based on students' mathematics achievements in raw, standardized, and Item Response Theory adjusted scaled test scores using propensity score matching. On average KA resulted in increasing students' raw and scaled test scores by 3.77 and 3.15 percentage points, respectively, and standardized test scores by 0.20 standard deviations above the mean test score. The evaluation provides initial evidence that the use of KA would help Sri Lankan students in mathematics. The findings are robust to alternative specifications, where school and teacher inputs are controlled for in addition to students' characteristics, and when estimation is limited to the subsample of students that had a common mathematics teacher across the treatment and the control groups.},

The research was evaluated in the light of both qualitative and quantitative data. Twenty-eight students studying in the department of mathematics education in a state university in Turkey comprised the study group of the research which was conducted using a mixed methods research design. A double integral achievement test and an open-ended questionnaire about the flipped classroom approach were used as data collection tools. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for the analysis of quantitative data and content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. According to the analysis of the research it was found that the flipped classroom approach designed with using both the Khan Academy and mathematics software increased student achievement in double integral. It was also found that this learning approach enhanced students' understanding and provided visualization in mathematics teaching. Moreover, it was revealed that this approach promoted retention and made understanding much easier.},

An increasing number of randomized controlled math interventions have been carried out across educational settings. The aim of the present systematic review was to identify the distribution of the randomized controlled math interventions conducted between 2001 and 2021 in educational settings across Early Childhood Education (ECE) up to high school among various sample types, and to describe their central features at each educational setting separately. Based on the knowledge gaps exposed through the systematic review, we aimed to discuss where and how future math interventions are still needed in order to optimize all children's math skill development across educational settings and sample types from early on. A total of n\,=\,75 math interventions meeting the inclusion criteria using the PRISMA-guidelines were identified, of which the majority of them were executed in the elementary school, mostly targeting at-risk children. It is proposed that there is still a large potential of promoting children's math skills from early on in the ECE settings, utilizing both teachers and parents, among at-risk and non-at-risk samples.},

  abstract = {The objective of this article is to conceptualize affective polarization beyond partisan politics to instead analyze the ways in which women's affective political participation is subject to toxic discipline. While a lot of focus has been placed on affective politics as mechanisms for governance, little has been done regarding affective polarization after feminist protest. In this article, we bridge two bodies of literature---affective politics and political polarization---by proposing the notion of affective polarization. We focused on the case of a series of feminist mobilizations that took place to fight back against the impunity of police violence in Mexico. We conducted a mixed-method approach that combines, on one hand, quantitative analysis of data strand tweets encompassing \#EllasNoMeRepresentan (TheyDoNotRepresentMe) (N\,=\,17,698) and \#EllasSiMeRepresentan (TheyDoRepresentMe) (N\,=\,6700) and, on the other hand, a qualitative analysis of 500 tweets of each hashtag. The results of the study revealed the existence of polarization that aims at disciplining the affective political participation of women. Almost half of our data contain negative sentiments. The toxic tweets include corrective threats, such as incitation to sexual violence, murder, hate against feminism, and patronizing discourses about how women should protest. We thus conclude that while it is true that social media has amplified feminist mobilization, it has also led to an increase of digital violence. With these findings, the article contributes to a better understanding of both feminist affective politics and its disciplining governing mechanisms in a patriarchal social media.},

Here we address the problem of sentiment analysis during critical events such as natural disasters or social movements. We consider Bayesian network classifiers to perform sentiment analysis on two datasets in Spanish: the 2010 Chilean earthquake and the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. In order to automatically control the number of edges that are supported by the training examples in the Bayesian network classifier, we adopt a Bayes factor approach for this purpose, yielding more realistic networks. The results show the effectiveness of using the Bayes factor measure as well as its competitive predictive results when compared to support vector machines and random forests, given a sufficient number of training examples. Also, the resulting networks allow to identify the relations amongst words, offering interesting qualitative information to historically and socially comprehend the main features of the event dynamics.},

Massive amounts of user-generated data sourced from various social networking platforms also provide new insights for businesses and governments. However, it has become difficult to extract useful information from the vast amount of information effectively. Sentiment analysis provides an automated method of analyzing sentiment, emotion and opinion in written language to address this issue. In the existing literature, a large number of scholars have worked on improving the performance of various sentiment classifiers or applying them to various domains using data from social networking platforms. This paper explores the challenges that scholars have encountered and other potential problems in studying sentiment analysis in social media. It gives insights into the goals of the sentiment analysis task, the implementation process, and the ways in which it is utilized in various application domains. It also provides a comparison of different studies and highlights several challenges related to the datasets, text languages, analysis methods and evaluation metrics. The paper contributes to the research on sentiment analysis and can help practitioners select a suitable methodology for their applications.},

Does a protest event occurring nearby, i.e., within an individual's neighborhood, impact their opinion? Do protests that happen further away, perhaps in the next county, have the same impact on public opinion? This study analyzes the impact of exposure to protests by focusing on the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in 2020 using public opinion data from Iowa merged with protest locations in Iowa. Specifically, we examine public support for BLM and for defunding the police. We evaluate the role of distance through a discrete mileage cut-off and a distance decay function. Our analysis shows that people living closer to protests show greater support for the BLM movement in general and, to a less extent, for defunding the police. The results suggest that protests may affect public opinion, but only within a very narrow range of a few miles.},

We argue that how protest tactics are perceived is not a purely objective determination, but can be influenced in part by observer characteristics -- in particular, by partisan identity. We conducted a survey experiment on two independent samples through the MTurk platform, randomly assigning protester group identity and tactics. Results show that when controlling for assigned tactics, self-identified Republicans but not Democrats perceive higher levels of violence when a disliked group is protesting. The effect is strongest in regard to tactics that are nominally the least disruptive. The findings have implications for theories of nonviolent protest, the legitimacy of repression, and the prospects for marginal groups to influence policy in polarized societies.},

Or, does the racialized nature of these events polarize mass opinion based on standing racial and political orientations? To answer these questions, we use a large dataset comprised of weekly cross sections of the American public and employ a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) approach leveraging the random timing of the police killing of George Floyd and ensuing nationwide protests. We find that the Floyd protests swiftly decreased favorability toward the police and increased perceived anti-Black discrimination among low-prejudice and politically liberal Americans. However, attitudes among high-prejudice and politically conservative Americans either remained unchanged or evinced only small and ephemeral shifts. Our evidence suggests that the Floyd protests served to further racialize and politicize attitudes within the domain of race and law enforcement in the U.S.},

I geocoded the ``martyrs''---demonstrators who died during the protests---using unique information from the Statistical Database of the Egyptian Revolution and exploited the variation in districts' exposure to the Egyptian protests across space and time. Controlling for district heterogeneity by examining the effect of the change in exposure to protests on the change in pro-regime and opposition support between the 2011 referendum and the 2012 elections, I find suggestive evidence that higher exposure to protest intensity leads to a higher share of votes for former regime candidates, both during the first and second rounds of Egypt's first presidential elections after the uprisings. I likewise find that greater exposure to protests is associated with an increased recognition of the importance of order and stability and greater willingness to trade-off human rights in exchange for security. Indeed, in governorates that were highly exposed to protests, individuals were more likely to report incidents of theft, destruction of personal or public property, and job loss. Socially and economically disruptive protests could therefore lead to a greater share of conservative votes in highly affected areas.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The scientific debate about populism has been revitalised by the recent rise of extreme-right parties in Western Europe. Within the broad discussion about populism and its relationship with extreme-right, this article is confined to three topics: a conceptual, an epistemological and an empirical issue. First, taking a clear position in the ongoing definition struggle, populism is defined primarily as a specific political communication style. Populism is conceived of as a political style essentially displaying proximity of the people, while at the same time taking an anti-establishment stance and stressing the (ideal) homogeneity of the people by excluding specific population segments. Second, it is pointed out that defining populism as a style enables one to turn it into a useful concept that has too often remained vague and blurred. Third, drawing on an operational definition of populism, a comparative discourse analysis of the political party broadcasts of the Belgian parties is carried out. The quantitative analysis leads to a clear conclusion. In terms of the degree and the kinds of populism embraced by the six political parties under scrutiny, the extreme-right party Vlaams Blok behaves very differently from the other Belgian parties. Its messages are a copybook example of populism.},

The label is often attached to a certain party without any justification. Minimal definitions are alternatives but lack rigor. Classical content analyses provide more systematic measurements of populism but are extremely resource hungry. This article proposes an alternative, quantitative text analysis to measure the degree of populism among Belgian parties, drawing on both internally and externally oriented party literature. The results confirm that usual suspects such as the Vlaams Belang or Lijst Dedecker are the most populist of all parties under study. Populism turns out not to be an ``either--or'' concept, however, since we also identify a moderately populist party. It is furthermore demonstrated how populism can be attached to other ideologies, such as the radical right and (neo)liberalism. A cross-validation of the proposed method with independent voter survey data confirms its validity. This article concludes that a quantitative text analysis might be a promising method to measure populism over time and space without the huge costs of hand coding.}

The median effect of intelligent tutoring in the 50 evaluations was to raise test scores 0.66 standard deviations over conventional levels, or from the 50th to the 75th percentile. However, the amount of improvement found in an evaluation depended to a great extent on whether improvement was measured on locally developed or standardized tests, suggesting that alignment of test and instructional objectives is a critical determinant of evaluation results. The review also describes findings from two groups of evaluations that did not meet all of the selection requirements for the meta-analysis: six evaluations with nonconventional control groups and four with flawed implementations of intelligent tutoring systems. Intelligent tutoring effects in these evaluations were small, suggesting that evaluation results are also affected by the nature of control treatments and the adequacy of program implementations.},

  abstract = {Digital technology offers the potential to address educational challenges in resource-poor settings. This meta-analysis examines the impact of students' use of technology that personalises and adapts to learning level in low- and middle-income countries. Following a systematic search for research between 2007 and 2020, 16 randomised controlled trials were identified in five countries. Studies involved 53,029 learners aged 6--15 years. Coding examined learning domain (mathematics and literacy); personalisation level and delivery; technology use; and intervention duration and intensity. Overall, technology-supported personalised learning was found to have a statistically significant---if moderate---positive effect size of 0.18 on learning (p = 0.001). Meta-regression reveals how more personalised approaches which adapt or adjust to learners' level led to significantly greater impact (an effect size of 0.35) than those only linking to learners' interests or providing personalised feedback, support, and/or assessment. Avenues for future research include investigating cost implications, optimum programme length, and teachers' role in making personalised learning with technology effective. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? Promoting personalised learning is an established aim of educators. Using technology to support personalised learning in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) could play an important role in ensuring more inclusive and equitable access to education, particularly in the aftermath of COVID-19. There is currently no rigorous overview of evidence on the effectiveness of using technology to enable personalised learning in LMICs. What this paper adds? The meta-analysis is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of technology-supported personalised learning in improving learning outcomes for school-aged children in LMICs. Technology-supported personalised learning has a statistically significant, positive effect on learning outcomes. Interventions are similarly effective for mathematics and literacy and whether or not teachers also have an active role in the personalisation. Personalised approaches that adapt or adjust to the learner led to significantly greater impact, although whether these warrant the additional investment likely necessary for implementation at scale needs to be investigated. Personalised technology implementation of moderate duration and intensity had similar positive effects to that of stronger duration and intensity, although further research is needed to confirm this. Implications for practice and/or policy: The inclusion of more adaptive personalisation features in technology-assisted learning environments can lead to greater learning gains. Personalised technology approaches featuring moderate personalisation may also yield learning rewards. While it is not known whether personalised technology can be scaled in a cost-effective and contextually appropriate way, there are indications that this is possible. The appropriateness of teachers integrating personalised approaches in their practice should be explored given `supplementary' uses of personalised technology (ie, additional sessions involving technology outside of regular instruction) are common.},

To support that research, we assembled a data set of key covariates for modeling ZIKV transmission dynamics in Colombia, where ZIKV transmission was widespread and the government made incidence data publically available. On a weekly basis between January 1, 2014 and October 1, 2016 at three administrative levels, we collated spatiotemporal Zika incidence data, nine environmental variables, and demographic data into a single downloadable database. These new datasets and those we identified, processed, and assembled at comparable spatial and temporal resolutions will save future researchers considerable time and effort in performing these data processing steps, enabling them to focus instead on extracting epidemiological insights from this important data set. Similar approaches could prove useful for filling data gaps to enable epidemiological analyses of future disease emergence events.},

We characterize the model and its balanced-growth path and propose a methodology to analyze equilibria with different levels of migration frictions. Different migration scenarios change local market size, innovation incentives, and the evolution of technology. We bring the model to the data for the whole world economy at a 1{$^\circ$} {\texttimes} 1{$^\circ$} geographic resolution. We then use the model to quantify the gains from relaxing migration restrictions. Our results indicate that fully liberalizing migration would increase welfare about threefold and would significantly affect the evolution of particular regions of the world.},

The present paper examines alternative measures of the precision of the estimates using bootstrap and prior estimates of the errors for both the luminosity quality and the national accounts quality. Based on the new results, we conclude: First, for countries with high quality systems, there is no reason to use luminosity data as a supplement to standard data in any context where standard data are available. Second, we find that there is no advantage at present of using lights data for time-series corrections for any purposes where standard data are available. Third, for countries with low quality statistical systems, the estimates suggest that there may be substantial information in the luminosity data for cross-sectional estimates of output. Fourth, the major concerns about the use of lights as a proxy involve uncertainties about the precision of standard national accounts data. Finally, we recommend that future work be concentrated on integrating luminosity data into the cross sectional estimates of national and regional output primarily for countries with poor quality statistical systems.},

The methodologies for the study are described. Three applications of the data are investigated. First, the puzzling ``climate-output reversal'' is detected, whereby the relationship between temperature and output is negative when measured on a per capita basis and strongly positive on a per area basis. Second, the database allows better resolution of the impact of geographic attributes on African poverty, finding geography is an important source of income differences relative to high-income regions. Finally, we use the G-Econ data to provide estimates of the economic impact of greenhouse warming, with larger estimates of warming damages than past studies.},

The framework is employed to assess the communicative styles of left-wing late Venezuelan president Hugo Ch{\'a}vez and former right-wing leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party Nigel Farage---two political actors who would not usually be considered as likely populist bedfellows.},

One obstacle to the study of populism from a global perspective is coming up with a measure of populism that is comparable across both space and time. In this paper, I clarify the theoretical concept of populism and introduce a novel computer-assisted supervised method combined with word embedding models for identifying populism in political texts. My method is highly generalizable and is not constrained by language. I demonstrate the usefulness of my method by measuring the degree of populism in English-language party manifestos and Chinese news articles. My method is able to identify populist texts with a high degree of accuracy in out-of-sample predictions, and therefore opens up new research opportunities to examine populism from a truly comparative perspective.},

The studied populist messages reflect ideational definitions of populism. Thus, populist messages appeal to the people, dismiss the elites as appalling, or highlight the people?s right to unfettered rule. Despite German-speaking countries offering a variety of populist parties, existing automated approaches are rarely applicable to German texts. Furthermore, they are not tailored to social media and often focus only on anti-elitism. I vastly improved existing dictionaries by analyzing populist ideology in its entirety, including people-centrism and the demand for people?s sovereignty. The article showed how known populist parties in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland spread these messages to a great extent on social media. Furthermore, I was able to highlight intra-party differences. Finally, the article discusses different aspects of validity and shows that the proposed approach offers high convergent validity and split-half reliability.},

It then operationalizes this definition through a holistic grading of speeches by current chief executives and a few historical figures. The result is a data set of elite-level populist discourse in more than 40 current and past governments from a variety of countries across the world, with special focus on Latin America. This measurement has high reliability comparable to standard human-coded content analysis, compares well to common understandings of actual cases of populism, and is a reasonably efficient technique even in small samples.},

The findings show how Trump uses an informal, direct, and provoking communication style to construct and reinforce the concept of a homogeneous people and a homeland threatened by the dangerous other. Moreover, Trump employs positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation to further his agenda via social media. This study demonstrates how his top-down use of Twitter may lead to the normalization of right-wing populist discourses, and thus aims to contribute to the understanding of right-wing populist discourse online.},

He addressed this group's concern by raising their moral status, that is, by (1) emphatically describing them as hard-working Americans who are victims of globalization; (2) voicing their concerns about `people above' (professionals, the rich, and politicians); (3) drawing strong moral boundaries toward undocumented immigrants, refugees, and Muslims; (4) presenting African Americans and (legal) Hispanic Americans as workers who also deserve jobs; (5) stressing the role of working-class men as protectors of women and LGBTQ people. This particular case study of the role of boundary work in political rhetoric provides a novel, distinctively sociological approach for capturing dynamics of social change.},

  abstract = {Common wisdom suggests that populist politicians use a simple language. While scholars have provided vast anecdotal evidence of populists' plain speech style, the empirical literature on populist communication offers very few and mixed comprehensive evaluations of the complexity of elected officials' language. This paper relies on a novel populist dictionary and 78,855 utterances from the 17th Italian parliament -- March 2013--July 2016 -- to comprehensively study the link between populism and speech complexity. We argue that ideological and electoral considerations lead populist parties and politicians to employ a straightforward language. Moreover, we claim that party membership shapes the rhetoric of elected officials, leading members of populist parties to use a simpler language. Using computer-assisted text analytic techniques to inspect parliamentary speeches given by the members of nine Italian parties, we perform a difference-in-differences analysis of the influence of party switching on legislators' behaviour. Our results suggest that populist ideology, electoral strategy, and party membership influence legislators' language complexity. Our overarching conclusion is that language simplicity might be thought of as a feature of populist communication. This arguably has implications for the ability of populist actors to use a simple communication style to outperform their mainstream counterparts when competing for voters' support.},

These tools have proved invaluable to scholars of the judiciary, of the legislature, and of political behavior; they hold great promise for the study of the presidency and bureaucracy. These methods' value lies in measuring complex, nuanced, yet theoretically critical quantities of interest like power, agenda setting, policy significance, ideology, and diplomatic resolve: by categorizing individual documents into a researcher-defined schema, automated text methods produce large-N data sets with fine temporal granularity. Recent work using text analysis to study unilateral actions illustrates these methods' promise for upturning conventional wisdom, settling long-standing debates, and illuminating new puzzles in executive politics in the United States.},

The estimates reveal that partisanship is far greater today than at any point in the past. Partisanship was low and roughly constant from 1873 to the early 1990s, then increased dramatically in subsequent years. Evidence suggests innovation in political persuasion beginning with the Contract with America, possibly reinforced by changes in the media environment, as a likely cause. Naive estimates of partisanship are subject to a severe finite-sample bias and imply substantially different conclusions.},

Here, we propose a method to derive a score of parties' levels of populism using supervised machine learning to perform textual analysis on national manifestos. We illustrate the advantages of our approach, which allows for measuring populism for a vast number of parties and countries without resource-intensive human-coding processes and provides accurate, updated information for temporal and spatial comparisons of populism. Furthermore, our method allows for obtaining a continuous score of populism, which ensures more fine-grained analyses of the party landscape while reducing the risk of arbitrary classifications. To illustrate the potential contribution of this score, we use it as a proxy for parties' levels of populism, analyzing average trends in six European countries from the early 2000s for nearly two decades.},

In this paper, we provide a detailed discussion of the suggested approach. Building on recent debates about the validation of machine-learning models, we argue that the validity checks provided in DCM's paper are insufficient. We conduct a series of additional validity checks and empirically demonstrate that the approach is not suitable for deriving populism scores from texts. We conclude that measuring populism over time and between countries remains an immense challenge for empirical research.

While some politicians and media outlets present it as dangerous to the U.S., Europe, and Latin America, others hail it as the fix for broken democracies. Not surprisingly, questions about populism abound. Does it really threaten democracy? Why the sudden rise in populism? And what are we talking about when we talk about "populism"?    \emph{The Global Rise of Populism}  argues for the need to rethink this concept. While still based on the classic divide between "the people" and "the elite," populism's reliance on new media technologies, its shifting relationship to political representation, and its increasing ubiquity have seen it transform in nuanced ways that demand explaining. Benjamin Moffitt contends that populism is not one entity, but a political style that is performed, embodied, and enacted across different political and cultural contexts. This new understanding makes sense of populism in a time when media pervades political life, a sense of crisis prevails, and populism has gone truly global.},

We first use holistic grading, applying the technique to electoral manifestos from 144 parties in 27 countries from Western Europe and the Americas; as a validity check, for about half the sample we also code campaign speeches by candidates or party leaders. Our results show that manifestos perform relatively well alone, and that populism is stronger in Latin America than in Europe; indeed, the level of populism among some European parties typically considered as examples of radical right populism might be overstated. We then contrast the results with automated textual analysis, applying supervised learning methods to generate a model that can correctly classify documents as populist or not. In this sample, the results are not fully satisfactory, performing well only if we restrict populist classification to a binary choice, but they indicate that with more data automated techniques could be a viable option.},

One of the most important payoffs of this comparative work is conceptual. Rather than defining populism in structuralist, economic, or political-strategic terms, a growing number of scholars around the world are using an ideational conceptualization that draws heavily from earlier discursive theories. By employing the ideational approach, scholars have been able to provide empirical measures of populist discourse. In this article we explain and show the advantages of this ideational approach to a Latin American audience by presenting a new historical dataset measuring the discourse of Argentine, Chilean, and Peruvian presidents across the twentieth century. Our main intent is to clarify the ideational approach as well as to enliven the conceptual debate. While we are critical of alternative definitions, we acknowledge and reassess their theoretical insights. Aun cuando el estudio del populismo ha sido tradicionalmente un campo de los latinoamericanistas, la investigaci{\'o}n al respecto se ha vuelto cada vez m{\'a}s comparativa. Uno de los beneficios m{\'a}s importantes de los trabajos comparados es conceptual. En vez de definir al populismo en t{\'e}rminos estructurales, econ{\'o}micos o pol{\'i}tico-estrat{\'e}gicos, un creciente n{\'u}mero de acad{\'e}micos alrededor del mundo utilizan una conceptualizaci{\'o}n ideacional vinculada con previas teor{\'i}as discursivas.

This article analyzes differences in the extent and nature of programmatic structuration in Latin America and Europe, using a new original data source, the Chapel Hill Expert Survey-Latin America (CHES-LA), in combination with the long-standing CHES-Europe. First, we demonstrate the reliability of CHES-LA in relation to CHES-Europe, and substantiate its validity by comparing it to other expert, elite and party manifesto surveys in Latin America. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we then show that while party system structuration in Latin America is somewhat lower than in Europe, it is also of a decisively different nature. In Latin America economic and socio-cultural policy positions are largely captured in a single overlapping dimension; in Europe, by contrast, competition occurs overwhelmingly along two dimensions, each with distinct clusters of policy positions.},

Since 1994, PELA has conducted around 9,000 personal interviews with representative samples of the Legislative Powers of 18 Latin American countries, generating a unique resource for the study of political elites in a comparative perspective. Now, this contributed volume brings together studies that dig into the data gathered by PELA to discuss important topics related to the challenges faced by representative democracy in Latin America. After an introductory chapter that presents the potential of the PELA database, the book is structured in two parts. The first addresses in eight chapters important aspects of representative democracy such as political ambition, political trust, satisfaction with democracy, clientelism and the quality of democracy. It then discusses three relevant issues in Latin American political dynamics such as executive-legislative relations, women's participation as representatives, and the meaning of China and the United States in national politics. The second part addresses in five chapters studies of seven national cases that are representative of regional heterogeneity. These chapters aim to examine parliamentarian elites' attitudes in different political systems with regard to a variety of relevant issues such as institutional trust, satisfaction with democracy, Executive-Legislative relations, clientelism, and gender questions. Furthermore, these chapters intend to evince the evolution of such attitudes in the course of the last two decades. Politics and Political Elites in Latin America: Challenges and Trends will be of interest to scholars and students of comparative politics in general and, more particularly, to those interested in the challenges faced by representative democracy not only in Latin America, but in many parts of the world.

Because the welfare of Latin American societies has always depended heavily on extracting and exporting natural resources, elite groups and factions have battled each other for control of this extraction and export and the largesse flowing from it.

It proposes that the collapse of Venezuela's ``ancien regime'' can best be understood by an examination of the impact the rise and fall of oil prices had on its economy, society, and polity. A 20-year economic decline led to the election of Hugo Chavez, a radical outsider, who refused to play along with the country's old political class. This class, in turn, refused to accept Chavez as the legitimately elected president and launched the country on an eight-year roller-coaster ride of counter-revolution and radicalization, which recently ended with the reelection of Chavez and a massive popular endorsement for the establishment of ``21st century socialism'' in Venezuela. Exactly what such a project means is still unclear, but it so far involves state support for self-managed workplaces and an anti-capitalist and participatory democratic state in the midst of a still functioning capitalist economy. With the apparent defeat of obstacles that are external to the Bolivarian movement, as the pro-Chavez movement is called, such as the domestic opposition and U.S. intervention, the movement is now forced to confront its internal obstacles, such as clientelism, corruption, and personalism, if it is to succeed in the long run.},

Applying the methodology proposed by Rooduijn and Pauwels (2011), I analyze the candidate's personal tweets from 5 May 2018 to 5 September 2018. The conclusion is that populism is an important element of Bolsonaro's rhetoric. First, he attacks political elites, accuses them of corruption, and blames them for the economic and political crises. Second, he appeals to the Brazilian people and claims to be the only candidate who will govern in their interest. Nevertheless, the construction of 'us', 'the people' is drawn in an exclusionary manner: he denies the existence of class, race, and gender conflicts; opposes minority rights; and does not present initiatives for social inclusion. Therefore, Bolsonaro detaches from Latin American inclusionary populism and shows similarities to Western European exclusionary populism. This fact is also illustrated by the radical aspect of his rhetoric: law and order are highly salient in his discourse, the second most frequent topic of his tweets. Finally, Bolsonaro embraces the free market economy, but as with other populist politicians, distributive issues have very limited space in his discourse.}

In the final round of the 1989 elections, Fernando Collor de Mello of the small National Reconstruction Party faced Luiz In{\'a}cio Lula da Silva, known by his nickname Lula, of the Workers' Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores; PT), which presented an uncommonly well-articulated platform and a clearly socialist ideology. Collor nevertheless gained the support of most of the parties},

  abstract = {Politics and political conflict often occur in the written and spoken word. Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods---they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

  abstract = {The electoral rise of Milei, that brought him up to the presidency of Argentina in 2023, has run in parallel with discussions about his use of populist ideas. Overall, Milei is characterised by his emphasis on economic issues, with an extreme pro-market position based on the Austrian school, but he also stands out for a strong anti-establishment discourse. While observers may consider these appeals as populist, a categorisation based on just this feature could be premature given the multidimensional nature of populism. This article tests the importance of populism in the discourse of Milei displaying an empirical strategy based on the holistic grading of key political discourses. Main results indicate that Milei's discourse is partially populist because it lacks a people-centred vision, even one anchored in market rationality. We expect these results will facilitate comparisons of the Argentinian case with other Latin-American cases in which populism and neoliberalism seem to be mutually reinforcing.},

Yet, a premature categorization based on outward similarities eventually leads to omitting important differences. The aim of this article is a typological assessment of four recent cases of right-wing populism in Latin America---Jair Bolsonaro (Brazil), Jos{\'e} Ant{\'o}nio Kast (Chile), Guido Manini R{\'i}os (Uruguay), and Javier Milei (Argentina)---to clarify their correspondence with Cas Mudde's concept of RRP. The questions to be addressed are the following: Are these four leaders and their parties radically right? Are they right-wing in cultural terms (nativist and authoritarian)? Are they populist? And do they have sufficient features in common to speak of a right-wing populist wave?},

  abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, ``powerful,'' ``strong'' and ``Paris'' are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-ofwords models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},
